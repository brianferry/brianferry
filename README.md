### Hello, I'm Brian 😶‍🌫️

Hello whoever you are.  My name is Brian Ferry, I've been working with computers in some form since the mid 00s when I started getting into PC games such as World of Warcraft.  Since then I've gotten a degree in computers and have been building apps and websites for floodplain mapping, waste and recycling collection, contracting work for banks and grocery stores! 

Started as full-stack running *Angular, .NET Framework / .NET Core Web Apis, SQL Server* and *MySQL*.  Nowadays though I'm entirely in frontend land working with web components using [Lit](https://lit.dev/). 

I've been a fan of open source for just about as long as I've been into coding and I'm very glad I get to work with some of the best people at Red Hat.

Daily Tools:

- 💻 [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) with [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) as my desktop
- 📝 [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my editor

Currently looking at adding the following tools into my daily habits:
- 👨‍💻 [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my editor
- 😺 [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) for my terminal w/ [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

Main projects currently working on:

- [Patternfly Elements](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-elements)
- [Red Hat Design System](https://github.com/RedHat-UX/red-hat-design-system)
